                    <h2>Bio</h2>
                    <p>I am Merve Coskun, a passionate software developer with experience in back-end and front-end development. I am currently pursuing a Computer Programming and Analysis degree at George Brown College, where I continue to refine my technical and problem-solving skills.</p>
                    
                    <p>My expertise includes Node.js, Swift (iOS), Python, Java, C#, HTML, CSS, and React. I have worked on various projects that enhanced my ability to build, optimize, and troubleshoot applications. I believe that great software is not just about writing code‚Äîit‚Äôs about understanding user needs, collaborating effectively, and continuously learning new technologies.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am working as a barista at Starbucks (2019 - Present), where I developed strong customer service, teamwork, and communication skills. My experience in social work and volunteering has helped me build empathy and a user-focused mindset, which I apply to software development.</p>

                    <p>My goal is to create impactful technology solutions while growing as a full-stack developer. I am always eager to learn, innovate, and contribute to projects that make a difference.</p>
